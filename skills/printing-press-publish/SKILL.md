# /printing-press publish

Publish a generated CLI from your local library to the [printing-press-library](https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library) repo as a pull request.

```bash
/printing-press publish notion-pp-cli
/printing-press publish notion
/printing-press publish
```

## Setup

Before doing anything else:

<!-- PRESS_SETUP_CONTRACT_START -->
```bash
# min-binary-version: 0.5.0

# Derive scope first — needed for local build detection
_scope_dir="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo "$PWD")"
_scope_dir="$(cd "$_scope_dir" && pwd -P)"

# Prefer local build when running from inside the printing-press repo.
if [ -x "$_scope_dir/printing-press" ] && [ -d "$_scope_dir/cmd/printing-press" ]; then
  export PATH="$_scope_dir:$PATH"
  echo "Using local build: $_scope_dir/printing-press"
elif ! command -v printing-press >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  if [ -x "$HOME/go/bin/printing-press" ]; then
    echo "printing-press found at ~/go/bin/printing-press but not on PATH."
    echo "Add GOPATH/bin to your PATH:  export PATH=\"\$HOME/go/bin:\$PATH\""
  else
    echo "printing-press binary not found."
    echo "Install with:  go install github.com/mvanhorn/cli-printing-press/cmd/printing-press@latest"
  fi
  return 1 2>/dev/null || exit 1
fi

PRESS_BASE="$(basename "$_scope_dir" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | sed -E 's/[^a-z0-9_-]/-/g; s/^-+//; s/-+$//')"
if [ -z "$PRESS_BASE" ]; then
  PRESS_BASE="workspace"
fi

PRESS_SCOPE="$PRESS_BASE-$(printf '%s' "$_scope_dir" | shasum -a 256 | cut -c1-8)"
PRESS_HOME="$HOME/printing-press"
PRESS_RUNSTATE="$PRESS_HOME/.runstate/$PRESS_SCOPE"
PRESS_LIBRARY="$PRESS_HOME/library"
PRESS_MANUSCRIPTS="$PRESS_HOME/manuscripts"
PRESS_CURRENT="$PRESS_RUNSTATE/current"

mkdir -p "$PRESS_RUNSTATE" "$PRESS_LIBRARY" "$PRESS_MANUSCRIPTS" "$PRESS_CURRENT"
```
<!-- PRESS_SETUP_CONTRACT_END -->

After running the setup contract, check binary version compatibility. Read the `min-binary-version` field from this skill's YAML frontmatter. Run `printing-press version --json` and parse the version from the output. Compare it to `min-binary-version` using semver rules. If the installed binary is older than the minimum, warn the user: "printing-press binary vX.Y.Z is older than the minimum required vA.B.C. Run `go install github.com/mvanhorn/cli-printing-press/cmd/printing-press@latest` to update." Continue anyway but surface the warning prominently.

## Configuration

```
PUBLISH_REPO_URL="https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library"
PUBLISH_REPO_DIR="$PRESS_HOME/.publish-repo"
PUBLISH_CONFIG="$PRESS_HOME/.publish-config.json"
```

### Publish config

`$PUBLISH_CONFIG` stores persistent publish settings as JSON. On first publish, create it with defaults. The user can edit it to change the library repo or module path base.

```json
{
  "repo_url": "https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library",
  "access": "push",
  "protocol": "ssh",
  "clone_path": "~/printing-press/.publish-repo",
  "module_path_base": "github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library"
}
```

The `module_path_base` field sets the Go module path prefix for published CLIs. During packaging, the full module path is constructed as `<module_path_base>/<category>/<cli-name>`. If the user wants CLIs published to a different repo or path, they edit this field.

## Step 1: Prerequisites

Verify `gh` is authenticated:

```bash
gh auth status
```

If this fails, stop and tell the user: "GitHub CLI is not authenticated. Run `gh auth login` first."

## Step 2: Resolve CLI Name

Run:

```bash
printing-press library list --json
```

Parse the JSON output into a list of CLIs.

**Name resolution order** (matches the score skill for consistency):

1. **Exact match:** If the argument matches a `cli_name` exactly, use it
2. **Suffix match:** If no exact match, try `<argument>-pp-cli`
3. **Glob match:** If no suffix match, search for entries where `cli_name` contains the argument as a substring. Cap at 5 most-recent matches. If multiple matches, present them via AskUserQuestion and let the user pick
4. **No match:** List all available CLIs and ask the user to pick or re-enter
5. **No argument:** If invoked with no name, list all CLIs sorted by modification time and let the user pick

When presenting matches, show the CLI name and modification time in a human-friendly format (e.g., "2 hours ago", "3 days ago").

## Step 3: Determine Category

Read `.printing-press.json` from the resolved CLI directory.

**Category resolution order:**

1. If the manifest has a `category` field, present it for confirmation:
   > "Publishing as **<category>**. OK?"
   Give the user the option to change it

2. If no `category` but `catalog_entry` is present, look it up:
   ```bash
   printing-press catalog show <catalog_entry> --json
   ```
   Extract the category from the result. Present for confirmation

3. If neither provides a category, present the full list via AskUserQuestion:
   - developer-tools, monitoring, cloud, project-management
   - productivity, social-and-messaging, sales-and-crm, marketing
   - payments, auth, commerce, ai, media-and-entertainment, devices, other

## Step 4: Validate

Run:

```bash
printing-press publish validate --dir <cli-dir> --json
```

Parse the JSON result. Display each check result to the user:

```
Validating <cli-name>...
  manifest        PASS
  go mod tidy     PASS
  go vet          PASS
  go build        PASS
  --help          PASS
  --version       PASS
  manuscripts     WARN (no manuscripts found)
```

If `"passed": false`, report the failing checks and **stop**. Do not create a partial PR.

Save the `help_output` field from the result — it's used in the PR description.

## Step 5: Managed Clone

The publish skill manages its own clone of the library repo at `$PUBLISH_REPO_DIR`.

### First-time setup

If `$PUBLISH_REPO_DIR` does not exist:

1. **Detect push access:**
   ```bash
   GH_USER=$(gh api user --jq '.login')
   HAS_PUSH=$(gh api repos/mvanhorn/printing-press-library --jq '.permissions.push' 2>/dev/null || echo "false")
   ```

2. **Detect git protocol:**
   ```bash
   USE_SSH=false
   if ssh -T git@github.com 2>&1 | grep -q "successfully authenticated"; then
     USE_SSH=true
   fi
   ```

3. **Clone based on access:**

   **Push access** (`HAS_PUSH` is `true`):
   ```bash
   # Clone directly — origin IS the upstream
   if [ "$USE_SSH" = "true" ]; then
     REPO_URL="git@github.com:mvanhorn/printing-press-library.git"
   else
     REPO_URL="https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library.git"
   fi
   git clone --depth 50 "$REPO_URL" "$PUBLISH_REPO_DIR"
   ```

   **No push access** (`HAS_PUSH` is `false`):
   ```bash
   # Fork first — fail explicitly if forking is blocked
   if ! gh repo fork mvanhorn/printing-press-library --clone=false 2>&1; then
     echo "ERROR: Could not fork mvanhorn/printing-press-library."
     echo "The repo may restrict forking, or you may already have a fork with a different name."
     echo "Fork manually at https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/fork"
     exit 1
   fi
   FORK="$GH_USER/printing-press-library"

   # Build URLs based on protocol preference
   if [ "$USE_SSH" = "true" ]; then
     FORK_URL="git@github.com:$FORK.git"
     UPSTREAM_URL="git@github.com:mvanhorn/printing-press-library.git"
   else
     FORK_URL="https://github.com/$FORK.git"
     UPSTREAM_URL="https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library.git"
   fi

   git clone --depth 50 "$FORK_URL" "$PUBLISH_REPO_DIR"
   cd "$PUBLISH_REPO_DIR"
   git remote add upstream "$UPSTREAM_URL"
   git fetch upstream
   ```

4. **Cache the config:**
   ```json
   {
     "repo_url": "https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library",
     "access": "push or fork",
     "gh_user": "<gh username>",
     "protocol": "ssh or https",
     "clone_path": "~/printing-press/.publish-repo",
     "module_path_base": "github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library"
   }
   ```
   Write to `$PUBLISH_CONFIG`. The `access` field determines the flow for all subsequent steps. The `gh_user` field is used for cross-repo PR heads. The `module_path_base` always references the upstream repo (PRs land there).

### Subsequent publishes

Read `$PUBLISH_CONFIG`, then re-check access in case it changed (user was granted push access, or access was revoked):

```bash
CURRENT_ACCESS=$(gh api repos/mvanhorn/printing-press-library --jq '.permissions.push' 2>/dev/null || echo "false")
CACHED_ACCESS=$(jq -r .access "$PUBLISH_CONFIG")

if [ "$CURRENT_ACCESS" = "true" ] && [ "$CACHED_ACCESS" = "fork" ]; then
  echo "Access upgraded to push. Reconfiguring clone..."
  rm -rf "$PUBLISH_REPO_DIR"
  # Re-run first-time setup with push access
fi
if [ "$CURRENT_ACCESS" = "false" ] && [ "$CACHED_ACCESS" = "push" ]; then
  echo "Push access revoked. Reconfiguring clone with fork..."
  rm -rf "$PUBLISH_REPO_DIR"
  # Re-run first-time setup with fork access
fi
```

If the clone was removed due to an access change, re-run first-time setup above. Otherwise, freshen the clone to match the canonical upstream:

```bash
cd "$PUBLISH_REPO_DIR"

if [ "$(jq -r .access $PUBLISH_CONFIG)" = "push" ]; then
  # Push access: origin IS the upstream
  git fetch origin
  git checkout main
  git reset --hard origin/main
else
  # Fork: origin is the fork, upstream is canonical
  git fetch upstream
  git checkout main
  git reset --hard upstream/main
  # Also sync origin (fork) so git push works cleanly
  git push origin main --force-with-lease 2>/dev/null || true
fi
```

Verify the clone is healthy:

```bash
git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree
```

If this fails, the clone is corrupt. Remove `$PUBLISH_REPO_DIR` and re-run first-time setup.

### Interrupted state recovery

Before creating a new branch, check for uncommitted changes:

```bash
cd "$PUBLISH_REPO_DIR"
git status --porcelain
```

If there are uncommitted changes, ask the user via AskUserQuestion:
- "Reset and start fresh"
- "Continue with existing changes"

If reset, run `git checkout -- . && git clean -fd`.

## Step 6: Package

Read `$PUBLISH_CONFIG` to get `module_path_base`. Construct the full module path:

```
MODULE_PATH="<module_path_base>/<category>/<cli-name>"
```

For example: `github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library/library/productivity/notion-pp-cli`

Run `publish package` with `--dest` to write directly into the publish repo:

```bash
printing-press publish package \
  --dir <cli-dir> \
  --category <category> \
  --dest "$PUBLISH_REPO_DIR" \
  --module-path "$MODULE_PATH" \
  --json
```

This removes any existing version of the CLI (handling category changes), copies the CLI source and `.manuscripts` directly into `$PUBLISH_REPO_DIR/library/<category>/<cli-name>/`, and rewrites the Go module path.

Parse the JSON result. Note the `staged_dir`, `module_path`, `manuscripts_included`, and `run_id`. The `module_path` field confirms the Go module path that was set in the packaged CLI's `go.mod` and import paths.

## Step 7: Check for Existing PR

Before creating a branch, check whether you have an open PR for this CLI. The `--author @me` filter ensures we only match PRs owned by the current user — if someone else published the same CLI name, we won't stomp their PR.

For fork-based PRs, the head includes the username prefix:

```bash
ACCESS=$(jq -r .access "$PUBLISH_CONFIG")
GH_USER=$(jq -r .gh_user "$PUBLISH_CONFIG")

if [ "$ACCESS" = "fork" ]; then
  HEAD_REF="$GH_USER:feat/<cli-name>"
else
  HEAD_REF="feat/<cli-name>"
fi

gh pr list --repo mvanhorn/printing-press-library --head "$HEAD_REF" --state open --author @me --json number,title,url
```

Parse the result:
- If the list is non-empty, store `EXISTING_PR_NUMBER` and `EXISTING_PR_URL` from the first entry
- If the list is empty or the command fails (network, auth), set `EXISTING_PR_NUMBER=""` — proceed as if no PR exists

If an existing open PR was found, inform the user:
> "Found your open PR #N for `<cli-name>`. Will update it with the new version."

This determines the flow in Step 8:
- **Existing open PR:** Overwrite the branch automatically, force-push, update the PR description
- **No open PR:** Standard flow — ask about branch conflicts if any, create a new PR

## Step 8: Branch, Commit, and PR

### Create branch

**If `EXISTING_PR_NUMBER` is set** (updating an existing PR):

Always overwrite the branch — the intent is clearly to update:

```bash
git checkout -B feat/<cli-name>
```

**If `EXISTING_PR_NUMBER` is empty** (no open PR):

Check for stale branches and competing PRs:

```bash
# Check local and remote branches
LOCAL_BRANCH=$(git branch --list "feat/<cli-name>" | head -1)
REMOTE_BRANCH=$(git ls-remote --heads origin "feat/<cli-name>" 2>/dev/null | head -1)

# If a remote branch exists, check who owns it
if [ -n "$REMOTE_BRANCH" ]; then
  # Check for ANY open PR on this branch (not just ours)
  OTHER_PR=$(gh pr list --repo mvanhorn/printing-press-library --head "feat/<cli-name>" --state open --json number,author --jq '.[0]' 2>/dev/null)
fi
```

**If another user's open PR exists on this branch** (`OTHER_PR` is non-empty and author is not `@me`):
> "Someone else has an open PR for `<cli-name>` (PR #N by @author). Creating a timestamped branch to avoid conflicts."

Auto-create a timestamped branch: `feat/<cli-name>-YYYYMMDD`. Do NOT offer to overwrite — that would stomp their work.

**If the branch exists but no competing PR** (stale branch from a previously closed/merged PR):

Ask via AskUserQuestion:
> "Found a stale branch `feat/<cli-name>` (likely from a previous publish). Overwrite it?"

- "Overwrite existing branch" — reuse the branch name
- "Create timestamped variant (feat/<cli-name>-YYYYMMDD)"

**If no branch exists:** Create normally.

```bash
# New branch:
git checkout -b feat/<cli-name>

# Overwrite existing:
git checkout -B feat/<cli-name>
```

### Update registry.json

The registry file has this structure:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "entries": [
    {
      "name": "<cli-name>",
      "category": "<category>",
      "api": "<api-display-name>",
      "description": "<from manifest or README>",
      "path": "library/<category>/<cli-name>"
    }
  ]
}
```

Read `$PUBLISH_REPO_DIR/registry.json`, parse the `entries` array (not the top-level object), add or update the entry for this CLI. Match on `name` field. Preserve `schema_version` and any other top-level fields.

Write back with `jq` or via the Write tool.

### Commit and push

```bash
cd "$PUBLISH_REPO_DIR"
git add library/ registry.json
git commit -m "feat(<api-name>): add <cli-name>"
```

Push to origin (which is the fork for non-push users, or the upstream for push users):

**If updating an existing PR** (`EXISTING_PR_NUMBER` is set):

```bash
git push --force-with-lease -u origin feat/<cli-name>
```

**If creating a new PR** and you chose "Overwrite existing branch" earlier:

```bash
git push --force-with-lease -u origin feat/<cli-name>
```

**Otherwise** (new branch, no conflicts):

```bash
git push -u origin feat/<cli-name>
```

### Create or update PR

Read `access` and `gh_user` from `$PUBLISH_CONFIG`. These determine how `gh pr create` is called.

**For fork-based PRs** (`access` is `fork`): use `--head <gh_user>:feat/<cli-name>` so GitHub creates a cross-repo PR from the fork to the upstream. Without `--head`, `gh pr create` would try to find the branch on the upstream repo (where the user can't push) and fail.

**For push-access PRs** (`access` is `push`): no `--head` needed — the branch is on the same repo.

Build the PR description from:
- The manifest (`description`, `api_name`, `category`, `printing_press_version`, `spec_url`)
- The `help_output` captured in Step 4
- The CLI's README (first 2-3 paragraphs, or note that README is missing)
- Links to `.manuscripts/<run-id>/research/` and `.manuscripts/<run-id>/proofs/` within the PR branch
- The validation results from Step 4
- A Gaps section listing any missing manifest fields

**PR description template:**

```markdown
## <cli-name>

<description from manifest, or "No description available">

**API:** <api_name> | **Category:** <category> | **Press version:** <printing_press_version>
**Spec:** <spec_url or "Not specified">

### CLI Shape

\`\`\`bash
$ <cli-name> --help
<help_output from validation>
\`\`\`

### What This CLI Does

<First 2-3 paragraphs from README.md in the CLI directory, or "README not found">

### Manuscripts

- [Research Brief](<link to library/<category>/<cli-name>/.manuscripts/<run-id>/research/>)
- [Shipcheck Results](<link to library/<category>/<cli-name>/.manuscripts/<run-id>/proofs/>)

### Validation Results

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Manifest | PASS/FAIL |
| go mod tidy | PASS/FAIL |
| go vet | PASS/FAIL |
| go build | PASS/FAIL |
| --help | PASS/FAIL |
| --version | PASS/FAIL |
| Manuscripts | PRESENT/MISSING |

### Gaps

<List any missing manifest fields, or omit this section if everything is present>
```

**If updating an existing PR** (`EXISTING_PR_NUMBER` is set):

```bash
cd "$PUBLISH_REPO_DIR"
gh pr edit "$EXISTING_PR_NUMBER" \
  --repo mvanhorn/printing-press-library \
  --body "<constructed PR body>"
```

Display: "Updated PR #N: <EXISTING_PR_URL>"

**If creating a new PR:**

```bash
cd "$PUBLISH_REPO_DIR"

# Read access mode from config
ACCESS=$(jq -r .access "$PUBLISH_CONFIG")
GH_USER=$(jq -r .gh_user "$PUBLISH_CONFIG")

if [ "$ACCESS" = "fork" ]; then
  gh pr create \
    --repo mvanhorn/printing-press-library \
    --head "$GH_USER:feat/<cli-name>" \
    --base main \
    --title "feat(<api-name>): add <cli-name>" \
    --body "<constructed PR body>"
else
  gh pr create \
    --repo mvanhorn/printing-press-library \
    --base main \
    --title "feat(<api-name>): add <cli-name>" \
    --body "<constructed PR body>"
fi
```

Display the PR URL prominently.

## Secret & PII Protection

Before creating the PR, verify that no secrets leaked into the packaged CLI.

**This matters because the library repo is public.** A leaked API key in a PR is
a security incident — anyone can see it, even if the PR is later closed.

### What the machine checks (deterministic)

The generation skill (`/printing-press`) runs an exact-value scan during Phase 5.5
if the user provided an API key. By the time publish runs, the machine's own
mistakes should already be caught. But the user may have edited files between
generation and publish.

### What publish checks (best-effort, warn-only)

1. **If `gitleaks` or `trufflehog` is installed**, run it on the staged directory:
   ```bash
   if command -v gitleaks >/dev/null 2>&1; then
     gitleaks detect --source "<staging-dir>/library" --no-git --verbose 2>&1
   elif command -v trufflehog >/dev/null 2>&1; then
     trufflehog filesystem "<staging-dir>/library" 2>&1
   fi
   ```
   These tools use vendor-specific patterns (Steam keys, Stripe keys, GitHub
   tokens) with low false-positive rates. Their findings are warnings — the
   user reviews and decides.

2. **If no scanning tool is installed**, do a lightweight check:
   - Verify no `.env` files, `session-state.json`, or `config.toml` with
     real credentials exist in the staged directory
   - Check README examples use `"your-key-here"` placeholders, not real values
   - Check manuscripts (if included) don't contain auth headers or cookie values

3. **Never include** in the staged directory:
   - `.env` files
   - `session-state.json`
   - Config files with real credentials
   - HAR captures with un-stripped auth headers

If any issues are found, warn the user and ask whether to proceed. The user
makes the final call — they may have intentionally included something the scan
flagged (e.g., a test fixture with a fake key). Don't block silently.

## Error Handling

- **`gh` not authenticated:** Detect in Step 1, tell user to run `gh auth login`
- **CLI not found:** Show available CLIs in Step 2, let user pick
- **Validation fails:** Show per-check results in Step 4, stop
- **Repo unreachable:** Report clearly in Step 5
- **Fork creation fails:** `gh repo fork` may fail if the user already has a fork with a different name, or if the org restricts forking. Report the error and suggest the user fork manually via the GitHub web UI.
- **Existing PR check fails:** Fall back to standard branch-conflict flow (treat as no existing PR)
- **Branch conflict (no existing PR):** Ask user in Step 8 (overwrite or timestamp)
- **Push fails:** For fork users, ensure they're pushing to their fork (origin), not upstream. Report the error, suggest checking `gh auth status` and `git remote -v`
- **Cross-repo PR creation fails:** If `gh pr create --head user:branch` fails with "head not found", the branch wasn't pushed to the fork. Verify with `git ls-remote origin feat/<cli-name>`
